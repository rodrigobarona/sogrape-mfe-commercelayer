# Commerce Layer Cart

The Commerce Layer Cart application (React) provides you with a production-ready shopping cart powered by Commerce Layer APIs. You can fork this repository and deploy it to any hosting service or use it as a reference application to build your own. A hosted version is also available.

## Getting started

1. Create your organization and get your credentials by following one of our [onboarding tutorials](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/welcome).

2. Configure the `selfHostedSlug` property in `/public/config.local.js` to match your organization slug (subdomain). If this file does not exist, create it using the following content:

```
window.clAppConfig = {
  domain: "commercelayer.io",
  selfHostedSlug: "<your-org-slug>",
}
```

3. Deploy the forked repository to your preferred hosting service. You can deploy with one click below:

4. Build your sales channel with your favorite technologies and frameworks by leveraging our [developer resources](https://commercelayer.io/developers) and [documentation](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api).

5. Get an [access token](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/authentication) for your application. You should generate this in your sales channel or use our Javascript [authentication library](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-js-auth).

6. Create an [order](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/v/api-reference/orders) associated with some [line items](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/v/api-reference/line_items).

7. View the cart associated with the previously created order using the URL format: `<your-deployed-cart-url>/:order_id?accessToken=<your-access-token>`.

### Example

`https://cart.yourbrand.com/PrnYhoVeza?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9`

## Hosted version

Any Commerce Layer account comes with a hosted version of the Cart application that is automatically enabled. You can customize it by adding your organization logo, favicon, primary color, and Google Tag Manager ID.

You can use the hosted version of the Cart application with the following URL format: `https://<your-organization-subdomain>.commercelayer.app/cart/:order_id?accessToken=<your-access-token>`

### Example

`https://yourbrand.commercelayer.app/cart/PrnYhoVeza?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9`

## Embedding the cart

The cart can be embedded in your application or website by loading the hosted URL in an inline frame. This way a compact version of the Cart app that doesn't show the header and the footer will be automatically rendered.

### Example

```
// hosted
<iframe src="https://yourbrand.commercelayer.app/cart/PrnYhoVeza?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9" width="100%" />

// forked
<iframe src="https://cart.yourbrand.com/PrnYhoVeza?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9" width="100%" />
```

> You can either set your iFrame to a fixed height or keep it responsive using the [iFrame Resizer](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer) library â€” the Cart app already includes the `iframeResizer.contentWindow` scripts, so you only need to add it to your parent app.

## Express checkout

The cart supports express checkout buttons for both Apple Pay and Google Pay via Stripe. To enable this feature, you need to activate the `auto_payments` option on your Commerce Layer [Stripe gateway](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/v/api-reference/stripe_gateways) and configure the necessary settings in your Stripe dashboard.

## Running on Windows
When working on Microsoft Windows, we suggest to use the PowerShell terminal or any alternative shell with the ability to run scripts as admin user.

This is required to install `pnpm` following the instruction [here](https://pnpm.io/installation#on-windows).

Once done, install globally the `touch-cli` package by running `pnpm add -g touch-cli` in order to successfully execute the `prepare` script.
